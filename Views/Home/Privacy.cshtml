      <p>
        Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests: We may disclose to parties outside UnitedOver, files stored
        in our database and personal data about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; or (b) to protect
        UnitedOver’s intellectual property rights. If we provide your Files to a law enforcement agency as set forth
        above, we will remove UnitedOver’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business Transfers: In case we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets,
        your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you and/or your
        organization (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use
        of your personal data or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in this Section, we may disclose your personal
        data where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in
        order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person. We may also disclose
        your personal data where such disclosure is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
        claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can access your information as well as store and share it in response to a request when the law requires us
        to do so. In addition, we may access your information, as well as store and share it, if we believe in good
        faith that this is necessary to: detect, prevent and manage fraud and other illegal activities; protect
        ourselves, you and other people, even in the context of any investigations; prevent events that could cause
        imminent physical damage or death

        <b>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a
        character string through which internet pages, servers or apps can be assigned to the specific app or server in
        which the cookie was stored.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the use of cookies, UnitedOver can provide the customers of this website with more customer-friendly
        services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our websites can be optimized with the customer in mind.
        Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our websites customers. The purpose of this recognition
        is to make it easier for customers to utilize our websites. The website's customer that uses cookies e.g. does
        not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the websites, and
        the cookie is thus stored on the customer's computer system.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact
        with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your
        browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the
        websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the
        Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some web browsers may transmit “do-no-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Our website does not currently respond to these “do-not-track” signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Strictly necessary cookies</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the Site and use its features, such as accessing
        secure areas. Without these cookies, some services you have asked for, such as payment submission, can’t be
        provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Performance cookies</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These cookies collect information about how you use the website, for example, which pages you go to most often
        and if you get error messages from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather information that identifies you.
        All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how the Site works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Functionality cookies</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you’re
        in). For instance, the Site uses functionality cookies to remember your language preference. These cookies can
        also be used to remember changes you’ve made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customize,
        or any kind of form that you left in between or unsubmitted. They may also be used to provide services you’ve
        asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be
        anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Targeting cookies</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also
        used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an
        advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with
        other organizations such as advertisers. This means after you have been to the Site you may see some
        advertisements about our services elsewhere on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a
        corresponding setting of the browser or app, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore,
        already set cookies may be deleted at any time. If the user or the visitor deactivates the setting of cookies in
        the browser or app, then not all functions may be entirely usable.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        We will be honest and open with you about the type of personal information that we collect about you and the
        actual use of any such information. We will let you know at the time we collect your personal information, or

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Sensitive Information</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not believe in intrusive collection of your personal details and will not collect information that is
        considered highly personal or highly sensitive about you without your prior consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Data Retention and Data Deletion</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We only retain the personal information collected from a Customer for as long as the Customer’s email address is
        active on our mailing list, or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfil the
        purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be
        retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the 2-year criteria, after your
        relationship with us ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
        which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Your rights</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you
        should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your principal rights under data protection law are:
      </p>
      <p>
        (a)the right to access;
      </p>
      <p>
        (b)the right to rectification;
      </p>
      <p>
        (c)the right to erasure;
      </p>
      <p>
        (d)the right to restrict processing;
      </p>
      <p>
        (e)the right to object to processing;
      </p>
      <p>
        (f)the right to data portability;
      </p>
      <p>
        (g)the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
      </p>
      <p>
        (h)the right to withdraw consent.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access
        to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details
        of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal
        data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply you a copy of your personal
        data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, considering the purposes of the
        processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances, you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those
        circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were
        collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing
        under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes, and the
        personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general
        exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
        information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
        claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances, you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances
        are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer
        need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment,
        exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that
        objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data.
        However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of
        legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important
        public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular
        situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary
        for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority
        vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an
        objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
        grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing is for the
        establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including
        profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal
        data for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research
        purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation unless the processing is
        necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a
        legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in
        the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the
        right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
        withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.
      </p>
